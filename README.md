## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🎯 ATS Resume Match (New!)
Upload your actual resume (`.txt`, `.md`) and let the AI Architect parse it in real-time. 
- **Skill Extraction**: Scans your profile against an engineering-specific skill database.
- **Job Readiness Score**: Calculates a weighted match percentage for top companies.
- **Searchable Targets**: Instantly find and analyze your fit for companies like Tesla, SpaceX, or Skyroot.
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifies critical missing skills and links them directly to your learning roadmap.

### 2. 🔍 Company Explorer (S4 - Hidden Gems)
Discover high-growth startups and niche MNCs beyond the "Big 5".
- **Hidden Gem 💎**: Identifies under-the-radar startups with massive growth potential.
- **Trending 🚀**: Highlights companies currently leading the market in EV and Space Tech.
- **Niche Filtering**: Filter by Startup vs MNC to find your ideal culture fit.

### 3. 🗺️ Skill Matrix & Roadmap (M1)
A tiered learning engine that prioritizes what matters most in today's market.
- **Tiered Priorities**: Categorizes skills into "Must Have" (Tier 1), "Core" (Tier 2), and "Specialization" (Tier 3).
- **Interactive Tree**: Visual nodes showing progress and skill categories (Technical, Soft Skills, Tools).

### 4. ⚡ AI Market Simulation (H1)
Demonstrates the "Magic" of AI adaptation.
- **Market Shift Simulation**: Trigger a "2026 Shift" to see how the platform dynamically re-orders your roadmap based on real-time market trends.
- **Adaptive UI**: Watch Azure DevOps get promoted over AWS in real-time as industry demand shifts.
